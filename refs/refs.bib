title = {Binary Black Hole Merger in Galactic Nuclei: Post-Newtonian Simulations},
abstract = {This paper studies the formation and evolution of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in rotating galactic nuclei, focusing on the role of stellar dynamics. We present the first N-body simulations that follow the evolution of the SMBHs from kiloparsec separations all the way to their final relativistic coalescence, and that can robustly be scaled to real galaxies. The N-body code includes post-Newtonian (P N) corrections to the binary equations of motion up to order 2.5; we show that the evolution of the massive binary is only correctly reproduced if the conservative 1 P N and 2 P N terms are included. The orbital eccentricities of the massive binaries in our simulations are often found to remain large until shortly before coalescence. This directly affects not only their orbital evolution rates, but has important consequences as well for the gravitational waveforms emitted during the relativistic inspiral. We estimate gravitational wave amplitudes when the frequencies fall inside the band of the (planned) Laser Interferometer Space Antennae (LISA). We find significant contributions---well above the LISA sensitivity curve---from the higher-order harmonics.},

title = {Gravitational-wave bursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies and quasars - Proposal for detection using Doppler tracking of interplanetary spacecraft},
abstract = {It is argued that the collapse which forms the supermassive black holes that are likely to exist in the nuclei of many quasars and galaxies, and collisions between those holes, should produce strong broadband bursts of gravitational waves. The mean time between such gravitational-wave bursts at earth is analyzed in terms of the present Hubble expansion rate, the present deceleration parameter of the universe, the redshift z = 2.5 (at which most of the bursts are assumed to have been generated), the present number density of 'centers' where the bursts originated, the mean number of bursts generated in each center during its active life, and the speed of light. The analysis shows that the range from one week to 300 years is reasonable for the time between bursts, although it is admitted that hardly any bursts at all is also reasonable. Expected characteristics of the bursts are deduced, and it is shown that the best detector for these bursts will probably be Doppler tracking of one or more interplanetary spacecraft.},

title = {Efficient Merger of Binary Supermassive Black Holes in Nonaxisymmetric Galaxies},
abstract = {Binary supermassive black holes (SBHs) form naturally in galaxy mergers, but their long-term evolution is uncertain. In spherical galaxies, N-body simulations show that binary evolution stalls at separations much too large for significant emission of gravitational waves (the ``final-parsec problem''). Here we follow the long-term evolution of a massive binary in more realistic, triaxial and rotating galaxy models with particle numbers as high as 106. We find that the binary does not stall. The binary hardening rates that we observe are sufficient to allow complete coalescence of binary SBHs in 10 Gyr or less, even in the absence of collisional loss-cone refilling or gasdynamical torques, thus providing a potential solution to the final-parsec problem.},

title = {Long-Term Evolution of Massive Black Hole Binaries},
abstract = {The long-term evolution of massive black hole binaries at the centers of galaxies is studied in a variety of physical regimes, with the aim of resolving the ``final parsec problem,'' i.e., how black hole binaries manage to shrink to separations at which emission of gravity waves becomes efficient. A binary ejects stars by the gravitational slingshot and carves out a loss cone in the host galaxy. Continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the loss cone. We show that the standard treatment of loss cone refilling, derived for collisionally relaxed systems like globular clusters, can substantially underestimate the refilling rates in galactic nuclei. We derive expressions for nonequilibrium loss cone dynamics and calculate timescales for the decay of massive black hole binaries following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantly higher decay rates than heretofore. Even in the absence of two-body relaxation, decay of binaries can persist as a result of repeated ejection of stars returning to the nucleus on eccentric orbits. We show that this recycling of stars leads to a gradual, approximately logarithmic dependence of the binary binding energy on time. We derive an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by the Brownian motion of a black hole binary. We also show that numerical N-body experiments are not well suited to probe these mechanisms over long times as a result of spurious relaxation.},

title = {Massive black hole binary mergers within subparsec scale gas discs},
abstract = {We study the efficiency and dynamics of supermassive black hole binary mergers driven by angular momentum loss to small-scale gas discs. Such binaries form after major galaxy mergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering becomes very inefficient at subparsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary dynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of binaries embedded within geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum transport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated by disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good agreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation of eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e >~ 0.35. Accretion on to the black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital frequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of binary decay that is possible without fragmentation occurring within the surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 105 <~ M <~ 108Msolar we find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~ 0.01-0.1pc, in the regime where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time-scale is shorter than the Hubble time for M <~ 107Msolar. This implies that gas discs could commonly attend relatively low-mass black hole mergers, and that a significant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few hundredths of a parsec, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive binaries, where this mechanism fails to act quickly enough, we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas disc could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.},

title = {Dynamics of binary-disk interaction. 1: Resonances and disk gap sizes},
abstract = {We investigate the gravitational interaction of a generally eccentric binary star system with circumbinary and circumstellar gaseous disks. The disks are assumed to be coplanar with the binary, geometrically thin, and primarily governed by gas pressure and (turbulent) viscosity but not self-gravity. Both ordinary and eccentric Lindblad resonances are primarily responsible for truncating the disks in binaries with arbitrary eccentricity and nonextreme mass ratio. Starting from a smooth disk configuration, after the gravitational field of the binary truncates the disk on the dynamical timescale, a quasi-equilibrium is achieved, in which the resonant and viscous torques balance each other and any changes in the structure of the disk (e.g., due to global viscous evolution) occur slowly, preserving the average size of the gap. We analytically compute the approximate sizes of disks (or disk gaps) as a function of binary mass ratio and eccentricity in this quasi-equilibrium. Comparing the gap sizes with results of direct simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), we obtain a good agreement. As a by-product of the computations, we verify that standard SPH codes can adequately represent the dynamics of disks with moderate viscosity, Reynolds number R approximately 103. For typical viscous disk parameters, and with a denoting the binary semimajor axis, the inner edge location of a circumbinary disk varies from 1.8a to 2.6a with binary eccentricity increasing from 0 to 0.25. For eccentricities 0 less than e less than 0.75, the minimum separation between a component star and the circumbinary disk inner edge is greater than a. Our calculations are relevant, among others, to protobinary stars and the recently discovered T Tau pre-main-sequence binaries. We briefly examine the case of a pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary GW Ori and conclude that circumbinary disk truncation to the size required by one proposed spectroscopic model cannot be due to Linblad resonances, even if the disk is nonviscous.},

In the simulations we consider a triple-disk system composing of two accretion disks around BHs and one circumbinary disk surrounding the two. The circumbinary disk works as a mass reservoir. We confirm that a non-axisymmetric accretion disk is formed around each BH. The X-ray luminosity of the secondary BH exhibits the double peaks every binary orbit, whereas that of the primary BH shows a single peak. Such properties can not be seen in the case of equal mass BBHs and therefore provide a potentially important observational signature of supermassive BBHs with low mass ratios.},

title = {Retrograde accretion and merging supermassive black holes},
abstract = {We investigate whether a circumbinary gas disc can coalesce a supermassive black hole binary system in the centre of a galaxy. This is known to be problematic for a prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking the binary because there are no orbital resonances. The binary directly absorbs negative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a disc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both holes if the binary mass ratio is close to unity. In many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric, shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases the binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas mass comparable to that of the secondary black hole. Importantly, this conclusion is unaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally super-Eddington for either hole. The coalescence time-scale is therefore always ?, where M2 is the secondary black hole mass and ? the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.},

Two techniques, radiation reaction and flux across a large sphere, are used in these calculations and are shown to be in agreement over a time average. In the nonrelativistic limit, the energy and angular momentum radiation and angular distributions are expressed in terms of time derivatives of the quadrupole tensor Qij. These results are then applied to a bound system of two point masses moving in elliptical orbits. The secular decays of the semimajor axis and eccentricity are found as functions of time, and are integrated to specify the decay by gravitational radiation of such systems as functions of their initial conditions.},

title = {Filling the disk hollow following binary black hole merger: The transient accretion afterglow},
abstract = {Tidal torques from a binary black hole empty out the central regions in any circumbinary gaseous accretion disk. The balance between tidal torques and viscosity maintain the inner edge of the disk at a radius {\&}rtilde;1.5a-2a, where a is the binary semimajor axis. Eventually, the inspiraling binary decouples from the disk and merges, leaving behind a central hollow (``donut hole'') in the disk orbiting the remnant black hole. We present a simple, time-dependent, Newtonian calculation that follows the secular (viscous) evolution of the disk as it fills up the hollow down to the black hole innermost stable circular orbit and then relaxes to stationary equilibrium. We use our model to calculate the electromagnetic radiation (``afterglow'') spectrum emitted during this transient accretion epoch. Observing the temporal increase in the total electromagnetic flux and the hardening of the spectrum as the donut hole fills may help confirm a binary black hole merger detected by a gravitational wave interferometer. We show how the very existence of the initial hollow can lead to super-Eddington accretion during this secular phase if the rate is not very far below Eddington prior to decoupling. Our model, though highly idealized, may be useful in establishing some of the key parameters, thermal emission features and scalings that characterize this transient. It can serve as a guide in the design and calibration of future radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general relativity.},

abstract = {The stellar ejection rate and the rates of change of the binary semimajor axis and eccentricity are derived from scattering experiments for the restricted three-body problem. They are used to study the evolution of binaries in simple models for galactic nuclei, starting soon after the black holes become bound and continuing until the evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational radiation or until the ejected mass is too large for the galaxy to be considered fixed. The eccentricity growth is found to be unimportant unless the binary forms with a large eccentricity. The scattering results suggest that a binary with masses m_1>=m_2 should not be considered hard until its orbital velocity exceeds the background velocity dispersion by a factor that scales as (1+m_1/m_2)^1/2. The results are compared with predictions from Chandrasekhar's dynamical-friction formula and with previous work on the capture and scattering of comets by planetary systems.},

title = {A New Approach for Probing Circumbinary Disks},
abstract = {Circumbinary disks are considered to exist in a wide variety of astrophysical objects, e.g., young binary stars, protoplanetary systems, and massive binary black hole systems in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, there is no definite evidence for the circumbinary disk except for some in a few young binary star systems. In this Letter, we study possible oscillation modes in circumbinary disks around eccentric and circular binaries. We find that prograde, nonaxisymmetric waves are induced in the inner part of the circumbinary disk by the tidal potential of the binary. Such waves would cause variabilities in emission line profiles from circumbinary disks. Because of prograde precession of the waves, the distance between each component of the binary and the inner edge of the circumbinary disk varies with the beat period between the precession period of the wave and the binary orbital period. As a result, light curves from the circumbinary disks are also expected to vary with the same period. The current study thus provides a new method to detect circumbinary disks in various astrophysical systems.},

title = {An Eccentric Circumbinary Accretion Disk and the Detection of Binary Massive Black Holes},
abstract = {We present a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic simulation of a thin, viscous, locally isothermal corotating disk orbiting an equal-mass Newtonian binary point mass on a fixed circular orbit. We study the structure of the disk after multiple viscous times. The binary maintains a central hole in the viscously relaxed disk with radius equal to about twice the binary semimajor axis. Disk surface density within the hole is reduced by orders of magnitude relative to the density in the disk bulk. The inner truncation of the disk resembles the clearing of a gap in a protoplanetary disk. An initially circular disk becomes elliptical and then eccentric. Disturbances in the disk contain a component that is stationary in the rotating frame in which the binary is at rest; this component is a two-armed spiral density wave. We measure the distribution of the binary torque in the disk and find that the strongest positive torque is exerted inside the central low-density hole. We make connection with the linear theory of disk forcing at outer Lindblad resonances (OLRs) and find that the measured torque density distribution is consistent with forcing at the 3:2 (m=2) OLR, well within the central hole. We also measure the time dependence of the rate at which gas accretes across the hole and find quasi-periodic structure. We discuss implications for variability and detection of active galactic nuclei containing a binary massive black hole.},

title = {Fast Coalescence of Massive Black Hole Binaries from Mergers of Galactic Nuclei: Implications for Low-frequency Gravitational-wave Astrophysics},
abstract = {We investigate a purely stellar dynamical solution to the Final Parsec Problem. Galactic nuclei resulting from major mergers are not spherical, but show some degree of triaxiality. With N-body simulations, we show that equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) hosted by them will continuously interact with stars on centrophilic orbits and will thus inspiral---in much less than a Hubble time---down to separations at which gravitational-wave (GW) emission is strong enough to drive them to coalescence. Such coalescences will be important sources of GWs for future space-borne detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on our results for equal-mass mergers, and given that the hardening rate of unequal-mass binaries is similar, we expect that LISA will see between ~10 and ~ few Ã— 102 such events every year, depending on the particular massive black hole (MBH) seed model as obtained in recent studies of merger trees of galaxy and MBH co-evolution. Orbital eccentricities in the LISA band will be clearly distinguishable from zero with e >~ 0.001-0.01.},

title = {Binary Black Hole Accretion Flows in Merged Galactic Nuclei},
abstract = {We consider accretion flows from circumbinary disks onto supermassive binary black holes on a subparsec scale of the galactic center based on a smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) code. Simulation models are presented for four cases; that is, a circular binary and an eccentric one, each with equal and unequal masses. We find that the circumblack-hole disks are formed around each black hole regardless of the simulation parameters. There are two-step mechanisms that cause accretion flow. First, tidally induced elongation of the circumbinary disk triggers mass inflow toward two closest points on the circumbinary disk. Then, the gas is increasingly accumulated on these two points owing to the gravitational attraction of black holes. Second, when the gas can pass across the maximum loci of the effective binary potential, it starts to overflow via their two points, and freely infalls to each black hole. In circular binaries, the gas continues to be supplied from the circumbinary disk, (i.e., the gap between the circumbinary disk and the binary black hole is always closed). In eccentric cases, the mass supply undergoes periodic on/off transitions during one orbital period because of the variation of the periodic potential. The gap starts to close after the apoastron, and to open again after the next periastron passage. Due to the gap closing/opening cycles, the mass-capture rates are eventually strongly phase dependent. This could provide observable diagnosis for the presence of supermassive binary black holes in merged galactic nuclei.},

title = {Supermassive black hole binaries in gaseous and stellar circumnuclear discs: orbital dynamics and gas accretion},
abstract = {The dynamics of two massive black holes in a rotationally supported nuclear disc of mass Mdisc = 108Msolar is explored using N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Gas and star particles are copresent in the disc. Described by a Mestel profile, the disc has a vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by stellar velocity dispersion. A primary black hole of mass 4 Ã— 106Msolar is placed at the centre of the disc, while a secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric corotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released in the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical friction, the two black holes form a close binary in ~10 Myr. The inspiral process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas present in the disc and is accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We detail the gaseous mass profile bound to each black hole that can lead to the formation of two small Keplerian discs, weighing ~2per cent of the black hole mass, and of size ~0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound particles increases (decreases) with time as the black holes spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double active galactic nucleus activity is expected to occur on an estimated time-scale of <~10 Myr, comparable to the inspiral time-scale. The double nuclear point-like sources that may appear during dynamical evolution will have typical separations of <~10 pc.},

We now present a binary black hole model for the central engine of 3C 273 where the rapid precession is tidally induced in the primary accretion disk inner region by a secondary black hole in a non-coplanar orbit. Using Î³- and X-ray data we estimate upper limits for the mass of the primary, and then we compute the relevant parameters of the system for a variety of disk models.

(1992). The period and amplitude of the wiggles can be explained as due to the orbital motion of a binary black hole with mass of order l0 exp 8 solar masses, mass ratio larger than 0.1, and orbital radius about 10 exp 16 cm. The jet's inclination to the line of sight should be small confirming the standard interpretation of superluminal motion and one-sidedness as due to relativistic motion in a direction close to the line of sight. The small orbital radius suggests that the binary has been losing a significant amount of orbital energy during the last 10 exp 7 yr, possibly by interaction with the matter which is flowing through the active galactic nucleus. The arcsec-scale radio structure provides additional support for a link between activity and binary evolution. If our interpretation of the mass wiggle in this quasar is correct, then many other quasars may contain massive binary black holes as well.},

title = {Multiple supermassive black holes in galactic bulges},
abstract = {We study the number and interaction rates of supermassive black holes in galactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation in which the spheroidal components of galaxies are formed by mergers. In bright ellipticals, the number of events that can eject a central supermassive binary black hole is large. Central binaries must therefore merge in less than a Hubble time - otherwise there will be too much scatter in the M*-Ïƒ* relation and too many off-centre galactic nuclei. We propose that binary black holes are able to merge during the major gas accretion events that trigger QSO activity in galaxies. If this is the case, less than 10 per cent of faint ellipticals and 40 per cent of bright ellipticals are predicted to harbour binary black holes with near equal masses at their centres. This binary may be ejected away from the centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic space in up to 20 per cent of the most luminous ellipticals. The number of low-mass black holes that can interact with the central object is predicted to be a strong function of galaxy luminosity. In most faint ellipticals, no black holes fall into the centre of the galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the most luminous ellipticals, an average of 10 low-mass black holes interact with the central supermassive object after this time. It is expected that stars will be ejected from galaxy cores as these low mass ratio binaries harden. Multiple black holes in galactic bulges thus provide a natural explanation for the strong systematic trends in the observed central density profiles of ellipticals as a function of luminosity.},

title = {Binary black holes and tori in AGN. II. Can stellar winds constitute a dusty torus?},
abstract = {In this second paper, in a series of two, we determine the properties of the stellar torus that we showed in the first paper to result as a product of two merging black holes. If the surrounding stellar cluster is as massive as the binary black hole, the torque acting on the stars ejects a fraction which extracts the binary's angular momentum. After the black holes coalesced on scales of ~ 107ut {yr}, a geometrically thick torus remained. In the present article we show that a certain fraction of the stars has winds, shaped into elongated tails by the central radiation pressure, which are optically thick for line of sights aligned with them. These stars are sufficiently numerous to achieve a covering factor of 1, so that the complete torus is optically thick. This patchy structured torus is then compared with observations. We find the parameters of such a torus to be just in the right range in order to explain the observed large column densities in AGN and their temporal variations on time scales of about a decade. Within this model the broad absorption line quasars can be interpreted as quasars seen at intermediate inclination angles, with the line of sight grazing the edge of the torus. The half-opening angle of the torus is wider for major mergers and thus correlates with the central luminosity, as has been suggested previously. In this picture the spin of the merged black hole is possibly dominated by the orbital angular momentum of the binary. Thus the spin of the merged black hole points into a new direction, and consequently the jet experiences a spin-flip according to the spin-paradigm. This re-orientation could be an explanation for the X-shaped radio galaxies, and the advancing of a new jet through the ambient medium for Compact Symmetric Objects.},

title = {Black Holes in Galaxy Mergers: The Formation of Red Elliptical Galaxies},
abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r~=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the local universe.},

title = {Efficient Merger of Binary Supermassive Black Holes in Merging Galaxies},
abstract = {In spherical galaxies, binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have difficulty reaching sub-parsec separations due to depletion of stars on orbits that intersect the massive binary---the "final parsec problem." Galaxies that form via major mergers are substantially non-spherical, and it has been argued that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxies might provide stars to the massive binary at a high enough rate to avoid stalling. Here we test that idea by carrying out fully self-consistent merger simulations of galaxies containing central SMBHs. We find hardening rates of the massive binaries that are indeed much higher than in spherical models and essentially independent of the number of particles used in the simulations. Binary eccentricities remain high throughout the simulations. Our results constitute a fully stellar-dynamical solution to the final parsec problem and imply a potentially high rate of events for low-frequency gravitational wave detectors like LISA.},

title = {Transformations of Galaxies. II. Gasdynamics in Merging Disk Galaxies},
abstract = {In mergers of disk galaxies, gas plays a role quite out of proportion to its relatively modest contribution to the total mass. To study this behavior, we have included gasdynamics in self-consistent simulations of collisions between equal-mass disk galaxies. The large-scale dynamics of bridge- and tail-making, orbit decay, and merging are not much altered by the inclusion of a gaseous component. However, tidal forces during encounters cause otherwise stable disks to develop bars, and the gas in such barred disks, subjected to strong gravitational torques, flows toward the central regions where it may fuel the kiloparsec-scale starbursts seen in some interacting disk systems. Similar torques on the gas during the final stages of a collision yield massive gas concentrations in the cores of merger remnants, which may be plausibly identified with the molecular complexes seen in objects such as NGC 520 and Arp 220. This result appears insensitive to the detailed microphysics of the gas, provided that radiative cooling is permitted. The inflowing gas can dramatically alter the stellar morphology of a merger remnant, apparently by deepening the potential well and thereby changing the boundaries between the major orbital families.},

title = {Dynamical Evolution of AGN Host Galaxies---Gas In/Out-Flow Rates in Seven NUGA Galaxies},
abstract = {To examine the role of the host galaxy structure in fueling nuclear activity, we estimated gas flow rates from several kpc down to the inner few 10 pc for seven nearby spiral galaxies, selected from the NUclei of GAlaxies sample. We calculated gravitational torques from near-infrared images and determined gas in/out-flow rates as a function of radius and location within the galactic disks, based on high angular resolution interferometric observations of molecular (CO using Plateau de Bure interferometer) and atomic (H I using the Very Large Array) gas. The results are compared with kinematic evidence for radial gas flows and the dynamical state of the galaxies (via resonances) derived from several different methods. We show that gravitational torques are very efficient at transporting gas from the outer disk all the way into the galaxies centers at ~100 pc; previously assumed dynamical barriers to gas transport, such as the corotation resonance of stellar bars, seem to be overcome by gravitational torque induced gas flows from other nonaxisymmetric structures. The resulting rates of gas mass inflow range from 0.01 to 50 M sun yr-1 and are larger for the galaxy center than for the outer disk. Our gas flow maps show the action of nested bars within larger bars for three galaxies. Noncircular streaming motions found in the kinematic maps are larger in the center than in the outer disk and appear to correlate only loosely with the in/out-flow rates as a function of radius. We demonstrate that spiral gas disks are very dynamic systems that undergo strong radial evolution on timescales of a few rotation periods (e.g., 5 Ã— 108 yrs at a radius of 5 kpc), due to the effectiveness of gravitational torques in redistributing the cold galactic gas.},

abstract = {In classical loss cone theory, stars are supplied to a central black hole via gravitational scattering onto low angular momentum orbits. Higher feeding rates are possible if the gravitational potential near the black hole is nonaxisymmetric and the orbits are chaotic. Motivated by recently published, self-consistent models, we evaluate rates of stellar capture and disruption in triaxial nuclei. Rates are found to substantially exceed those in collisionally resupplied loss cones, as long as an appreciable fraction of the orbits are centrophilic. The mass captured by a black hole after a given time in a steep (Ï~r-2) nucleus scales as Ïƒ5 with Ïƒ the stellar velocity dispersion, and the accumulated mass in 1010 yr is of the correct order to reproduce the M*-Ïƒ relation. Triaxiality can solve the ``final parsec problem'' of decaying black hole binaries by increasing the flux of stars into the binary's loss cone.},

title = {Self-gravity and quasi-stellar object discs},
abstract = {The outer parts of standard steady-state accretion discs around quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) are prone to self-gravity, and they might be expected to fragment into stars rather than feed the central black hole. Possible solutions to this well-known problem are examined with an emphasis on general dynamic constraints. Irradiation by the QSO is insufficient for stability even if the outer disc is strongly warped. Marginal local gravitational instability enhances viscous transport but extends the stable regions only modestly. Compton cooling in the observed QSO radiation field rules out hot thick discs unless the local accretion rate is vastly super-Eddington. The formation of stars or stellar-mass black holes, and the release of energy in these objects by fusion or accretion, may help to stabilize the remaining gas in an otherwise standard disc. But at fixed mass accretion rate, the energy inputs required for stability increase with radius; beyond a parsec, they approach the total QSO luminosity and are probably unsustainable by stars. Magnetic torques from a wind or corona, and gravitational torques from bars or global spirals, may increase the accretion speed and reduce the density of the disc. But dynamical arguments suggest that the accretion speed is at most sonic, so that instability still sets in beyond about a parsec. Alternatively, the QSO could be fed by stellar collisions in a very dense stellar cluster, but the velocity dispersion would have to be much higher than observed in nearby galactic nuclei containing quiescent black holes. In view of these difficulties, we suggest that QSO discs do not extend beyond a thousand Schwarzschild radii or so. Then they must be frequently replenished with gas of small specific angular momentum.},

title = {The Afterglow of Massive Black Hole Coalescence},
abstract = {The final merger of a pair of massive black holes in a galactic nucleus is compelled by gravitational radiation. Gravitational waves from the mergers of black holes of masses 105-107(1+z)-1 Msolar at redshifts of 1-20 will be readily detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, but an electromagnetic afterglow would be helpful in pinpointing the source and its redshift. Long before the merger, the binary ``hollows out'' any surrounding gas and shrinks slowly compared to the viscous timescale of a circumbinary disk. The inner gas disk is truncated at the radius where gravitational torque from the binary balances the viscous torque, and accretion onto the black holes is diminished. Initially, the inner truncation radius is able to follow the shrinking binary inward. But eventually the gravitational radiation timescale becomes shorter than the viscous timescale in the disk, leading to a merged black hole surrounded by a hollow disk of gas. We show that the subsequent viscous evolution of the hollow, radiation pressure-dominated disk will create an ~1043.5(M/106 Msolar) ergs s-1 X-ray source on a timescale ~7(1+z)(M/106 Msolar)1.32 yr. This justifies follow-up monitoring of gravitational wave events with next-generation X-ray observatories. Analysis of the detailed light curve of these afterglows will yield new insights into the subtle physics of accretion onto massive black holes.},

Nonlinear effects are analyzed through a quasi-linear flow analysis ordered by successive powers of a dimensionless spiral perturbing force, which is the ratio of imposed nonaxisymmetric gravitational to axisymmetric gravitational forces. Waves with mn arms are launched from a position where the wavenumber of a free wave matches n times the wavenumber of the spiral forcing. The launched short wave in the gas is an interarm feature that is more tightly wrapped than the stellar wave. The gas wave extracts energy and angular momentum from the stellar wave, causing it to damp. The application of the results to the stellar disk alone reveals even stronger damping, as stars undergo Landau damping of the short wave. For parameters in M81, damping times are less than 10 exp 9 yr.},

title = {On the Wave Excitation and a Generalized Torque Formula for Lindblad Resonances Excited by External Potential},
abstract = {The existing theory of density wave excitation in two-dimensional gaseous disks by imposed gravitational potentials makes approximations which prevent a direct analytical description of the shifts in effective positions of Lindblad resonances with respect to radii satisfying orbital commensurability requirement, and of the so-called torque cutoff arising at large azimuthal numbers m of the perturbing potential's pattern. Both phenomena are related to the azimuthal forces acting on gas, neglected in the WKB approximation commonly used in the past. We extend previous theories of Lindblad resonance wherever necessary for a consistent analytical treatment of the problem, particularly for large m. Our analytical approach applies to wave excitation at Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating, two-dimensional gas layers (vertically averaged disks or fundamental vertical mode of three-dimensional disks). It explicitly includes the resonance shifts and torque cutoffs. The theory is valid for small perturbing potentials of arbitrary form (including highly localized potentials, e.g., point-mass potential, spiral potential with arbitrary pitch angle, etc.). We present a torque formula generalizing the standard Goldreich-Tremaine formula. Especially useful in the problem of disk-satellite interaction, the torque formula provides insight into the origin of the torque cutoff at m larger than the radius to thickness ratio of the disk. Qualitatively, the cutoff is an effect of: (i) a mild (power-law) intrinsic torque cutoff, independent of the radial profile of the imposed potential, and (ii) a sharp (exponential) cutoff due to shifts in effective resonance location away from the perturber. For m â†’ âˆž the latter effect causes the increasingly localized potential to decouple spatially from the wave generation region. A disk annulus surrounding the corotation radius of every m-armed potential, of width comparable with twice the vertical disk scale height, remains evanescent for waves excited by that harmonic and does not contribute significantly to the total torque between the perturber and the disk. We discuss the role of gas viscosity, self-gravity, and the applicability of a two-dimensional analysis to Lindblad resonances in three-dimensional disks.},

title = {Protoplanet Migration by Nebula Tides},
abstract = {The tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a circumstellar gaseous disk results in mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the secondary. There are two, conceptually distinct circumstances wherein nebula torques can cause a secular variation in a protoplanet's semimajor axis. (I) The net torque exerted on a secondary by an undisturbed disk is not, in general, zero. Although gradients in the disk density and temperature can contribute to this torque, it is mostly due to asymmetries in the disk/planet interaction that are inherent to a Keplerian disk. For a relatively thick disk, the differential torque can be a significant fraction of the torque from either its exterior or its interior portion. In this case, the protoplanet drifts relative to disk material on a time scale inversely proportional to its mass. (II) The protoplanet opens a gap in the disk that establishes a flow barrier to disk material. A density discontinuity that locks the protoplanet into the disk's viscous evolution develops across the orbit. The protoplanet migrates on a time scale set by the disk's viscosity. A unified model that clarifies the relationship between these migration types and reveals under what circumstances a given type is selected is presented. In both cases, orbital decay is the prevailing outcome, although type I migration rates can be between one and two orders of magnitudes faster than type II. Estimates of orbital lifetimes are given and are generally shorter than the expected lifetime of the disk. Some implications to the issue of planetary formation are discussed.},

title = {Disk-Satellite Interaction via Density Waves and the Eccentricity Evolution of Bodies Embedded in Disks},
abstract = {Using a generalized torque formula for Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating gaseous disks we study the interaction of disks with small, embedded bodies (not able to open a gap). For satellites on circular orbits, the generalized torque formula reproduces exactly the torque cutoff occurring at high azimuthal number m of the potential harmonics, originally found seminumerically by Goldreich {\&} Tremaine (1980) in the shearing coordinates representation. The cutoff is attributable to the shift in the effective Lindblad resonance position with respect to the nominal resonant radius given by the usual period commensurabilty requirement. We apply the theory to the problem of orbital eccentricity evolution of embedded satellites. We relax some of the assumptions implicit in previous calculations related to this problem, most importantly that of a spatially smooth perturbing potential. We treat the co-orbital and the external Lindblad resonances within a unified formalism. We calculate the total rate of eccentricity damping due to co-orbital resonances and the excitation due to external resonances, the former exceeding the latter by a factor roughly equal to 3, independent of the method of averaging over the vertical disk structure. In application to a solar nebula with embedded planetesimals, the timescales of eccentricity damping for a wide range of planetesimal masses are much shorter than those corresponding to either gas drag, planetesimal growth, or nebular lifetime, and thus relevant to the scenarios of planetary system formation. In application to large (radius > 10 m) particles in Saturn's rings we estimate that the eccentricity is damped on the orbital timescale},

abstract = {The linear response of a differentially rotating two-dimensional gas disk, both with and without self-gravity, to a rigidly rotating external potential is calculated on the assumptions that the speed of sound is much smaller that the orbital velocity and that the external potential varies on the scale of the disk radius. The results show that: (1) the external potential exerts torques on the disk only at the Lindblad and corotation resonances; (2) the torque is positive at the outer Lindblad resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad resonance; (3) the torque at corotation has the sign of the radial vorticity gradient; and (4) the torques are of the same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and independent of the speed of sound in the disk. It is found that the external potential also excites density waves in the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances, that the long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad resonance, and that short trailing waves are excited at the corotation resonance. The behavior of particle disks is briefly discussed, and the external torques on particle disks are proven to be identical to those on gas disks},

title = {Hydrodynamical response of a circumbinary gas disc to black hole recoil and mass loss},
abstract = {Finding electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of future gravitational wave (GW) sources would bring rich scientific benefits. A promising possibility, in the case of the coalescence of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB), is that the prompt emission from merger-induced disturbances in a supersonic circumbinary disc may be detectable. We follow the post-merger evolution of a thin, zero-viscosity circumbinary gas disc with two-dimensional simulations, using the hydrodynamic code FLASH. We analyse perturbations arising from the 530 km s-1 recoil of a 106Msolar binary, oriented in the plane of the disc, assuming either a non-radiative gamma-law or a pseudo-isothermal equation of state for the gas. We find that a single-armed spiral shock wave forms and propagates outwards, sweeping up ~40 per cent of the mass of the disc. The morphology and evolution of the perturbations agrees well with those of caustics predicted to occur in a collisionless disc. Assuming that the disc radiates nearly instantaneously to maintain a constant temperature, we estimate the amount of dissipation and corresponding post-merger light curve. The luminosity rises steadily on the time-scale of months, and reaches few âˆšÃ³1043 ergs-1, corresponding to ~10 per cent of the Eddington luminosity of the central SMBHB. We also analyse the case in which gravitational wave emission results in a 5 per cent mass loss in the merger remnant. The mass loss reduces the shock overdensities and the overall luminosity of the disc by ~15-20 per cent, without any other major effects on the spiral shock pattern.},

abstract = {We report Chandra observations of a double X-ray source in the z = 0.1569 galaxy SDSS J171544.05+600835.7. The galaxy was initially identified as a dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidate based on the double-peaked [O III] Î»5007 emission lines, with a line-of-sight velocity separation of 350 km s-1, in its Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum. We used the Kast Spectrograph at Lick Observatory to obtain two long-slit spectra of the galaxy at two different position angles, which reveal that the two Type 2 AGN emission components have not only a velocity offset, but also a projected spatial offset of 1.9 h -1 70 kpc on the sky. Chandra/ACIS observations of two X-ray sources with the same spatial offset and orientation as the optical emission suggest that the galaxy most likely contains Compton-thick dual AGNs, although the observations could also be explained by AGN jets. Deeper X-ray observations that reveal Fe K lines, if present, would distinguish between the two scenarios. The observations of a double X-ray source in SDSS J171544.05+600835.7 are a proof of concept for a new, systematic detection method that selects promising dual AGN candidates from ground-based spectroscopy that exhibits both velocity and spatial offsets in the AGN emission features.},

The search for such binary black holes is therefore of great interest for several topics in astrophysics ranging from galaxy formation to activity in galaxies.},

title = {The Population of Viscosity- and Gravitational Wave-driven Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Among Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei},
abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in galactic nuclei are thought to be a common by-product of major galaxy mergers. We use simple disk models for the circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbital decay of SMBHBs with a range of total masses (M) and mass ratios (q), through physically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the viscous decay is generically in the stalled "secondary-dominated" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible fraction of a fiducial time of 107 yr at orbital periods between days lsimt orblsim yr, and we argue that they may be sufficiently common to be detectable, provided they are luminous during these stages. A dedicated optical or X-ray survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance obeys the scaling N var vprop t Î± var within a range of periods around t var~ tens of weeks. SMBHBs with M lsim 107 M sun, with 0.5 lsim Î± lsim 1.5, would probe the physics of viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass binaries, with Î± = 8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The lowest-mass SMBHBs (M lsim 105-6 M sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short orbital periods, when they are already in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are negligible in the last few years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolved background due to near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss modest constraints on the SMBHB population already available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coverage requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified from velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of SMBHBs as a function of their orbital velocity.},

title = {The evolution of a supermassive binary caused by an accretion disc},
abstract = {The interaction between a massive binary and a non-self-gravitating circumbinary accretion disc is considered. The shape of the stationary twisted disc produced by the binary is calculated. It is shown that the inner part of the disc must lie in the binary orbital plane for any value of the viscosity. When the inner disc mid-plane is aligned with the binary orbital plane on the scales of interest and it rotates in the same sense as the binary, the modification to the disc structure and the rate of decay of the binary orbit, assumed circular, caused by tidal exchange of angular momentum with the disc, are calculated. It is shown that the modified disc structure is well described by a self-similar solution of the non-linear diffusion equation governing the evolution of the disc surface density. The calculated time-scale for decay of the binary orbit is always smaller than the `accretion' time-scale t_acc=m/Msolar (m is the mass of the secondary component, and Msolar is the disc accretion rate), and is determined by the ratio of the secondary mass m, assumed to be much smaller than the primary mass, the disc mass inside the initial binary orbit, and the form of viscosity in the disc.},

    title = "{Eccentricity of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Coalescing from Gas-rich Mergers}",
    abstract={Angular momentum loss to circumbinary gas provides a possible mechanism for overcoming the ``last parsec'' problem and allowing the most massive black hole binaries formed from galactic mergers to coalesce. Here we show that if gas disks also catalyze the merger of the somewhat lower mass binaries detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), then there may be a purely gravitational wave signature of the role of gas in the form of a small but finite eccentricity just prior to merger. Numerical simulations suggest that eccentricity, excited by the interaction between the binary and surrounding gas disk, is only partially damped during the final phase of gravitational radiation-driven inspiral. We estimate a typical eccentricity at 1 week prior to coalescence of e~0.01. Higher terminal eccentricities, which can approach e=0.1, are possible if the binary has an extreme mass ratio. The detection of even a small eccentricity prior to merger by LISA provides a possible discriminant between gas-driven inspirals and those effected by stellar processes.},

    title = "{The Assembly and Merging History of Supermassive Black Holes in Hierarchical Models of Galaxy Formation}",
    abstract={We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z~6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z~20 from high-? density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a ?CDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1<z<5. A scheme for describing the hardening of a BH binary in a stellar background with core formation due to mass ejection is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to r-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing <~10 percent to the total BH mass density, ?SMBH=4?105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10 percent today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3 percent  at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 ? (4 ?) density peaks at z=20.},

    title = "{Limiting eccentricity of subparsec massive black hole binaries surrounded by self-gravitating gas discs}",
    abstract = {We study the dynamics of supermassive black hole binaries embedded in circumbinary gaseous discs, with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. The subparsec binary (of total mass M and mass ratio q= 1/3) has excavated a gap and transfers its angular momentum to the self-gravitating disc (Mdisc= 0.2M). We explore the changes of the binary eccentricity, e, by simulating a sequence of binary models that differ in the initial eccentricity e0 only. In initially low-eccentric binaries, the eccentricity increases with time, while in high-eccentric binaries e declines, indicating the existence of a limiting eccentricity ecrit that is found to fall in the interval [0.6, 0.8]. We also present an analytical interpretation for this saturation limit. An important consequence of the existence of ecrit is the detectability of a significant residual eccentricity eLISA by the proposed gravitational wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It is found that at the moment of entering the LISA frequency domain eLISA÷ 10-3-10-2, a signature of its earlier coupling with the massive circumbinary disc. We also observe large periodic inflows across the gap, occurring on the binary and disc dynamical time-scales rather than on the viscous time. These periodic changes in the accretion rate (with amplitudes up to ÷100 per cent, depending on the binary eccentricity) can be considered a fingerprint of eccentric subparsec binaries migrating inside a circumbinary disc.},

title = {The Population of Viscosity- and Gravitational Wave-driven Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Among Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei},
abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in galactic nuclei are thought to be a common by-product of major galaxy mergers. We use simple disk models for the circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbital decay of SMBHBs with a range of total masses (M) and mass ratios (q), through physically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the viscous decay is generically in the stalled "secondary-dominated" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible fraction of a fiducial time of 107 yr at orbital periods between days lsimt orblsim yr, and we argue that they may be sufficiently common to be detectable, provided they are luminous during these stages. A dedicated optical or X-ray survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance obeys the scaling N var vprop t Î± var within a range of periods around t var~ tens of weeks. SMBHBs with M lsim 107 M sun, with 0.5 lsim Î± lsim 1.5, would probe the physics of viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass binaries, with Î± = 8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The lowest-mass SMBHBs (M lsim 105-6 M sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short orbital periods, when they are already in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are negligible in the last few years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolved background due to near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss modest constraints on the SMBHB population already available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coverage requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified from velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of SMBHBs as a function of their orbital velocity.},
