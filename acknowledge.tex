The work presented here is the tip of an iceberg, constructed with the
guidance, compassion, and effort of many. After six years in New York City,
building towards this body of work, I have a lot of people to thank; so
I will first thank you for forgiving my lack of brevity.


First, and foremost are my advisors and mentors Zolt\'an Haiman and Janna
Levin. I hold a very deep respect for you both, and gratitude for all you
have done for me. I hope our collaborations continue for a long time. Thank
you for listening to me, pushing me, and for giving up any sleep you might
have lost for my sake.

I have been lucky to have had many influential mentors, whom I must thank for
getting me to where I am today. Without my high school teachers Thomas Gill,
and Brent Criswell, I don't think I would have ever realized in time that
physics is something that I love, and that I had the option of pursuing. In
college, Susan Esch gave me the confidence and positive influence that I
needed to succeed. Her and my the math and physics departments at Juniata College I owe a great deal. Namely, James White, Mark Pearson, Norman Siems, Barry Bruce, James Borgardt, and Mary Atchley.

After college I had the great privilege to work with Prasenjit Saha at the
University of Z\"urich, someone who taught me patience (though one can always
learn more) and what pure thought can do. I also remember a trip Prasenjit and
I took to Konstanz, Germany where a long walk with him helped me to decide
to focus on the research that is now the subject of this thesis.
Many others influenced my in Z\"urich, and though I cannot fit them all I would
like to thank, most importantly, Raymond Angelil and Theolosdia Charpidou -
I've never enjoyed myself doing physics more than with Ray and I have not had
many better parties than with he and Thea. I must also thank Doug Potter,
Jonathan Coles, Antoine Klein, Cedric Studerhoff, Simone Callegari, David
Martizi, Marina Galvani, Isabella Avigo, Ben Moore, Lucio Mayer, Roman
Tessier, Joachim Stadel, George Lake, Miguel Pato, Christine Moran, and Tina
Wentz for my time in Z\"urich.


At Columbia I was influenced by so many, my fellow graduate students with
which long discussions and many happy hours I endured, you know who you are, excpet for David Hendel (and he knows what I mean). %Adrian Price-Whelan,
%Jeff Andrews, Lia Corrales, Destry Saul, Cameron Hummels, Duane Lee, Erika
%Hamden, Josh Tan, Taka Tanaka, Jana Grcevich, Niel Zimmerman, Andrea
%Derdzinski, Sarah Pearson, Munier Salem, Susan Clark, Aleksay Generozov,
%Steven Mohammed, Davide Jaimes, Ron Tso, and never David Hendel (he knows what
%I mean). 
Thank you to my colleagues Brian Farris and Paul Duffel who taught me a great
deal about numerical hydrodynamics and to Geoffrey Ryan, Matt Turk, Jeff
Oishi, Nick Stone, Larry Price, Adrian Price-Whelan, Jeff Andrews, and Andreas
K\"upper for many interesting discussions. Thanks to Summer Ash, Marcel Ag\"ueros,
and Dave Deutsch for the the only times I actually used a telescope in
graduate school, those great evenings with the Columbia outreach and RV
programs. Thanks to all of the Columbia Astronomy faculty as well as Andrew
MacFadyen, Lam Hui, Andrea Beleborodov, Brian Metzger, and Kristen Menou, all
of whom mentored me along the way. Thank you to Millie, Ayoune, and Tom
Tarduagno without whom I would have never made it through the loans,
paperwork, and bureaucracy.

I could not have done without my friends these past 6 years. Thanks for the
late nights and long trips John O'Donnell, Matt Wilde, Ben Gilmour, Adam
Bisogne, Marina Harnik, Andrea Derdzinski, Adrian Price-Whelan, Jeff Andrews, Duane Lee, Sarah Pearson, Lia Corrales, Kevan Crotan, any many more...

Finally, I thank my family who has been behind me every moment - it has made
all of the difference. I thank my parents John and Pamela D'Orazio for
encouraging me to be curious, for teaching me to be open minded, and for
always supporting me wherever that curiosity has lead. I thank my sister
Nickie for getting me that apartment in Harlem where we certainly had some
times, and for always being my most unconditional supporter and critic. Thanks
to my grandparents John J. and Barbara D'Orazio, and Ray and Peggy Fryling, I
couldn't have done without your support. Thanks to my best friends and
brothers Ryan and Alex Patterson, my Aunt Patty and Uncle Steve, my
Aunt Pat Payne RIP, and to David and Ryan - may the Growler never sink.
