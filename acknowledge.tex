The work presented here is the tip of an iceberg, constructed with the
guidance, compassion, and effort of many. After six years in New York City,
building towards this body of work, I have a lot of people to thank; so
I will first thank you for forgiving my lack of brevity.

First, and foremost are my advisors and mentors Zoltan Haiman and Janna
Levin. I hold a very deep respect for you both, and gratitiude for all you
have done for me. I hope our colloborations continue for a long time (also I
need you to keep correcting my grammar Janna). I can't thank you both enough
for listening to me, pushing me, and for giving up that sleep you might have
lost for my sake.

I have been lucky to have had many influential mentors, whom I must thank for
getting me to where I am today. Without my high school teachers Thomas Gill,
and Brent Criswell, I don't think I would have ever realized in time that
physics is something that I love, and that I had the option to pursue it
proffessionally. In college, Susan Esch gave me the confidence and positive
influence that I needed to suceed. Her and my wonderful professors at Juniata
College, James White, Mark Pearson, Norm Siems, Barry Bruce, James Borgardt,
Mary Atchley, Catherine Stenson, James Bukowski, and Kim Roth helped me to
thrive in the beginning stages of my career.

After college I had the great privelage to work with Prasenjit Saha at the
University of Zurich, someone who taught me patience (though one can always
learn more) and what pure though can do. I also remember a trip Prasenjit and
I took to Konstanz, Germany where a long walk with him helped me to decide
that I wanted to work on the topic that is now the subject of this thesis.
Many others influenced my in Zurich, and though I cannot fit them all I would
like to thank, most importantly, Raymond Angelil and Theolosdia Charpidou -
I've never enjoyed myself doing physics more than with Ray and I have not had
many better parties than with he and Thea. I must also thank Doug Potter,
Jonathan Coles, Antoine Klein, Cedric Studerhoff, Simone Callegari, David
Martizi, Marina Galvani, Isabella Avigo, Ben Moore, Lucio Mayer, Roman
Tessier, Jochim Stadel, George Lake, Miguel Pato, Christine Moran, and Tina
Wentz for my time in Zurich.

At Columbia I was influenced by so many, my fellow graduates students with
which long discussions and many happy hours I endured: Adrian Price-Whelan,
Jeff Andrews, Lia Corrales, Destry Saul, Cameron Hummels, Duane Lee, Erika
Hamden, Josh Tan, Taka Tanaka, Jana Grcevich, Niel Zimmerman, Andrea
Derdzinski, Sarah Pearson, Munier Salem, Susan Clark, Aleksay Generozov,
Steven Mohammed, Davide Jaimes, Ron Tso, and never David Hendel (he knows what
I mean). Thank you to my colleagues Brian Farris and Paul Duffel who taught me
a great deal about numerical hydrodynamics and to Geoffrey Ryan, Matt Turk,
Jeff Oishi, Nick Stone, Larry Price, and Andreas Kupper for many interesting
discussions. Thanks to Summer Ash, Marcel Agueros, and Dave Deutsch for the
the only times I actually used a telescope in graduate school, those great
evenings with the Columbia outreach and RV programs. Thanks to all of the
Columbia Asytonomy faculty as well as Andrew MacFadyen, Lam Hui, Andrea
Beleborodov, Brian Metzger, and Kristen Menou, all of whom mentored me along
the way. Thank you to Millie, Ayoune, and Tom Tarduagno without whom I would
have never made it through the loans, paperwork, and beuracrocy.

In nyc: Nickie, Ryan, David

Finally I could not have done without my friends these past 6 years. Thanks for the late nights and long trips John O'Donnell, Matt Wilde, Ben Gilmour, Adam Bisogne, Andrea Derdzinski, Marina Harnik, Kevan Crotan, David Muirhead, and last but not least Ryan Patterson - may the Growler never sink.
