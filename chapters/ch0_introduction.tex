At 09:50 UTC on September 14, 2015, the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves from the merger of two $\sim 30 \msun$ black holes. This first direct detection of gravitational radiation (gravitational waves or GWs for short) and first unequivocal confirmation of the existence of black holes has ushered in a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. In this era, multi-wavelength and multi-messenger (photons, gravitons, neutrinos) observations of GW sources will be crucial for making the next steps to...

Human knowledge of the ... has come largely from our ability to sense photons.... into GWs

Gravitational radiation is generated when the shape of a mass-energy distribution changes in time. More precisely, when quadrapole and higher moments of a mass distribution have a changing current, metric perturbations
\begin{equation}
h_{i j} = \frac{2G}{d c^4} \ddot{Q}_{ij},
\end{equation}
are generated and propagates through space as gravitational waves. Here $G$ and $c$ are the usual gravitational constant and the speed of light, while $d$ is the distance from observer to source of radiation, and $ \ddot{Q}_{ij}$ is the second time derivative of the mass-energy quadrapole tensor. The units of $\ddot{Q}_{ij}$ are a mass times a velocity squared. Hence the wave amplitude is set by twice the kinetic energy $M v^2$ put into changing the quadrapolar moment of a mass-energy distribution times a coupling constant $2 Gc^{-4}d^{-1}$ and the coupling constant is determined from the strength of quadrapolar tidal field. The minuscule size of this coupling constant is perhaps the reason that it has taken a century since their prediction to detect gravitational waves. That is, to experience gravitational wave amplitudes of order unity, one must put a detector at a distance $d= 2GMc^{-2} (v/c)^2$ from a system of mass $M$ and with typical velocities $v$. This is distance is of order the gravitational radius, telling us that the largest possible gravitational waves are generated by mass distributions with velocities approaching the speed of light and packed into a space the size of a black hole event horizon. GWs with larger amplitudes are shielded by an event horizon. Hence, in building a gravitational wave emitter, black holes are the golden standard in components. As we have not yet built black holes in a laboratory we look to astrophysical sources. The best known astrophysical sources which approach the dimensions discussed above are
\begin{itemize}
\item Mergers of two (or more) compact objects, namely black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs \citep{}. At the time of writing this class of sources is the only to have been detected in gravitational waves\citep{GW091415}. Two such binary systems are the subjects of this thesis.
\item Inflation \citep[\textit{e.g.}][]{Guzzatti:2016}.
\item Cosmological defects such as comic strings  \citep[\textit{e.g.}][]{}.
\item Neutron star mountains  \citep[\textit{e.g.}][]{}.
\item Supernovae  \citep[\textit{e.g.}][]{}.
\end{itemize}


The methods for detecting gravitational waves is nearly as varied as the sources themselves. Just as for EM radiation, detector design depends on the radiation frequency. For the gravitational wave sources most relevant to this thesis, coalescing binary systems, the gravitational wave frequency for a binary on a circular orbit is given by twice the orbital frequency
\begin{equation}
f_{\GW} = 2 f_{\orb} \approx  \frac{1}{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{G M }{a^3}}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the total binary mass and $a$ is the binary separation Eccentric orbits emit gravitational waves over a spectrum of frequencies spanning the circular frequency and its higher order harmonics. For astrophysical black holes, which range in mass from $\sim 1 \Msun \rightarrow 10^{10} \Msun$, the gravitational wave frequency covers ten orders of magnitude. Assuming $a = 2GM/c^2$ at merger, this range gives $f_{\GW} = 10^4 \rightarrow 10^{-6}$ Hz. Considering also GW emission during the inspiral stage, the largest black holes emit at frequencies of $f_{\GW} \sim 10^{-9}$ Hz at separations of order $100 GM/c^2$.

LIGO\\
Existing instruments built on Earth to detect high frequency radiation from smaller Mass - LIGO, VIRGO and friends.

PTAs\\
The very long wavelength radiation from the inspiral of the most massive black hole binaries can be detected by the Pulsar timing arrays.

eLISA\\
The merger of the most massive black holes as well as the inspiral of middle weight MBHBs and nearby white dwarf binaries will be detectable by future space based interferometers such as eLISA.

CMB\\
Gravitational radiation from inflation is thought to permeate the universe at much lower frequencies than the binary populations. Experiments attempting to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background is attempting to detect this $\sim 10^{-16}$ Hz relic radiation \citep{}.













The broad motivation of this thesis is to examine astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation in the context of their astrophysical environments and, in this way, deduce the possibilities for EM observations of GW events which could produce multi-messenger events or serve as pure EM observations identifiers of GW events in absence of a GW detection.


But what can we do with EM detections of gravitational wave sources? A goal of this thesis is indeed to elucidate this question for two specific cases of neutron star black hole (NSBH) binaries and massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). In order to place this goal in greater context, we first survey the known literature on uses of EM signatures of GW sources. It is useful to separate these into two categories

\paragraph{EM counterparts} When an EM signal is observable in close temporal proximity to an observable GW event, we call this an EM counterpart because it is a counterpart to the GWs (I suppose we could just as likely call this a GW counterpart to an EM source). Examples in the literature include:
\begin{itemize}
\item gas squeezing X-ray flare at merger (Menou Cheng, snowplough papers?)
\item Disk response to BH recoil
\item SGRBs
\item ...
\end{itemize}
as well as the BH battery mechanism detailed in \ref{} of this thesis.

\paragraph{EM only} In the case that EM radiation can identify the a GW source 

 



%This thesis has focused on predicting the observable electromagnetic signatures of two specific sources of gravitational radiation.  So I need to :



The specific sources of GWs studied in this thesis are the inspiral and merger of MBHBs in galactic nuclei and the merger of magnetized NSs with $\gsim 10 \Msun$ BHs.
