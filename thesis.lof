Plotted over the streamlines are contours of the x-components of the fields relative to the $y-z$ magnitude. Darker regions represent negative values and lighter regions represent positive values. The white regions are clipped to better view the contour structure. The snapshots here are taken at $g_Ht = 1/4$, however the fields retain the same structure for all time except for their motion in the x-direction (out of the page). The axes are in units of $z_S$. Since the source is boosted, observers near the horizon see the fields as they would have been when the dipole was further away in the negative x-direction. The result is an observed dragging of the fields along the horizon in the negative x-direction. The observed larger radius of curvature of the dipole lobes manifests itself as the flattening of the field lines. As can be gathered from Figure \ref {ST_Boost}, this effect is intensified for larger boost factor $v_{S, x}$. In the $v_{S, x}=0.9$ case, plotted at the bottom of the figure, the 2D slice of the magnetic field loses its dipolar structure in most of the region below the source. As $v_{S, x}$ approaches $1$, the slope of the source worldline approaches the light cone slope and an observer at a given $z$ will see further and further into the relative past of the dipole. Note also that the contours in the left panels show that the circulation direction of the dipole lobes changes sign at a value of $z$ which gets larger for larger $v_{S, x}$. This change in sign results since observers near the horizon see fields from further in the past when the fields were pointing in a different x-direction. The increase in z-location of this turning point for larger $v_{S, x}$ can again be understood from Figure \ref {ST_Boost}. \relax }}{211}{figure.caption.65}

Each snapshot is taken at $g_H t=10$. The configuration drags along the stretched horizon keeping a constant lag distance behind the moving source.
